###infowolfe.sd-agent

[Server Density] is a cloud based monitoring service providing cloud management, site/app checks and instance monitoring. Its Python based agent is relatively simple, very configurable and trivially extended by the use of either paid or home-rolled plugins. This [Ansible] role is for deploying the [Server Density] agent from within your playbook.

### Installation

This role requires [Ansible] >= 1.5

### Requirements

Warning: this role uses the 'uri' module, which depends on httplib2, which will be installed automatically for you.

### Role Variables

At the moment, only 2 variables are required to be set. This section may expand in the future to include more.

```yaml
---
sd_url: "https://example.serverdensity.io"
sd_api_token: "your_api_key"
sd_group: "{{ tag_class_foo }}" # optional definition of SD group
```

Failure to define the above will likely cause this role to bail out, as there will never be default values set for `sd_url` or `sd_api_token`.

Optional variables: (and their defaults). More info can be found in `roles/infowolfe.sd-agent/templates/config.cfg.j2`

```yaml

- sd:
  - loglevel: error
